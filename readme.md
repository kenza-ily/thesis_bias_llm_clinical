# Bias in Large Language Models: Evaluation and Mitigation in Real-World Clinical Cases

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data for my Master's Thesis for **MSc AI for Biomedicine and Healthcare** at UCL. I'm investigating bias evaluation and mitigation in Large Language Models (LLMs) within clinical contexts. Key aspects of the research include:

1. Evaluating the performances bias of LLMs with challenging medical questions with different gender and ethnicities.
2. Exploring mitigation strategies with prompting and fine-tuning for bias mitigation in clinical LLMs.
3. Evaluating LLM performance on complex, real-world clinical cases using the [JAMA Network Clinical Challenge archive](https://jamanetwork.com/collections/44038/clinical-challenge)

This research builds upon the UNESCO 2024 Report on Gender Bias in LLM and aims to develop a comprehensive and rigorous framework for mitigating bias in clinical LLMs, ultimately promoting fairness and reducing the potential for discriminatory outputs in healthcare AI applications.
