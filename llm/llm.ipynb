The patient had false-positive syphilis test results during 2 pregnancies, 25 and 22 years prior, based on a positive blood rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test result (titer, 1:2 [reference, nonreactive]) and negative fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA-ABS) test result. On current presentation, she had erythematous annular and indurated plaques on her face, trunk, and extremities (Supplement). Laboratory testing revealed positive cardiolipin IgM (150 U/mL [reference, <13 U/mL]) and cardiolipin IgG (40 U/mL [reference, <15 U/mL]) antibodies. RPR titer was 1:1024. Skin biopsy revealed a dense perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The patient was not taking any new prescriptions or over-the-counter medications and did not use herbal supplements. She had no history of sexually transmitted infections and was sexually active with 1 male partner for the past 12 months \\n *How Do You Interpret These Test Results?* \\n A. Primary syphilis is likely. \\n B. Secondary syphilis is likely. \\n C. The rapid plasma reagin is a false-positive result due to cardiolipin antibodies. \\n D.

       "'A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows. B, Tzanck smear using Wright-Giemsa staining of specimen demonstrating ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material (original magnification ×20). What Is Your Diagnosis?'"
